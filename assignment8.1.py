Consider sample data as follows: sample_data=range(1,11)


Create two functions: odd() and even()
The function even() returns a list of all the even numbers from sample_data
The function odd() returns a list of all the odd numbers from sample_data


Create a function sum_of_numbers() which will accept the sample data and/or a function.
If a function is not passed, the sum_of_numbers() should return the sum of all 
the numbers from sample_data
If a function is passed, the sum_of_numbers() should return the sum of numbers returned 
from the function passed.
